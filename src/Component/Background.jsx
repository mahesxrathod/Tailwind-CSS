          Amazon Rainforest
        </p>
        The Amazon rainforest, also called Amazon jungle or Amazonia, is a moist
        broadleaf tropical rainforest in the Amazon biome that covers most of
        the Amazon basin of South America. This basin encompasses 7,000,000 km2
        (2,700,000 sq mi), of which 5,500,000 km2 (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered
        by the rainforest. This region includes territory belonging to nine
        nations and 3,344 formally acknowledged indigenous territories. The
        majority of the forest, 60%, is in Brazil, followed by Peru with 13%,
        Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Bolivia, Ecuador, French
        Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela. Four nations have "Amazonas" as
        the name of one of their first-level administrative regions, and France
        uses the name "Guiana Amazonian Park" for French Guiana's protected
        rainforest area. The Amazon represents over half of Earth's remaining
        rainforests, and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of
        tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion
        individual trees in about 16,000 species.

        Albert Einstein's theory of relativity is actually two separate
        theories: his special theory of relativity , postulated in the 1905
        paper, The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies and his theory of general
        relativity , an expansion of the earlier theory, published as The
        Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity in 1916. Einstein sought
        to explain situations in which Newtonian physics might fail to deal
        successfully with phenomena, and in so doing proposed revolutionary
        changes in human concepts of time, space and gravity.
